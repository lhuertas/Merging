This software is intended to submit the "searching for offset" or "merging" jobs on lxbatch.
It is very simple and needs to be developed. Feel free to add anything useful.
 
If you want to use that software it is necessary to:
 - source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/gcc/4.4.3/x86_64-slc5-gcc43-opt/setup.sh
 - source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/app/releases/ROOT/5.26.00a/x86_64-slc5-gcc43-opt/root/bin/thisroot.sh
 - compile the CMSTotem software with this gcc and root versions
The same gcc and root is then sourced on lxbatch. (It's due to some compiler issues on lxbatch)

To generate a script that will allow you to submit jobs on lxbatch:
 - adjust setup.py
 - run "python createScripts.py"
 
To submit the jobs:
 - go to directory "submit"
 - type "./submit.sh"
